## Code Tour

Base hono app exported from [app.ts](./src/app.ts).
Local development uses [@hono/node-server](https://hono.dev/docs/getting-started/nodejs) defined in [index.ts](./src/index.ts)

> update this file or create a new entry point to use your preferred runtime.

Type safe env defined in [env.ts](./src/env.ts) - add any other required environment variables here.

> The application will not start if any required environment variables are missing

I have used very **untraditional** file structure, but it works well for me.

- The `db` folder is only for drizzle migrations and pulling from the database.
- I have used _postgres schema_ feature for better separation of concerns.
- For respected schema, I have created folder under `src/routes` with the same name as the schema.
- For every table in that schema, I have created folder with the same name as the table of that schema.

See [src/routes/hr](./src/routes/hr/) for an example Open API group.

> Copy this folder / use as an example for your route groups.

Routing Folder [routes](./src/routes)

- Schema [hr](./src/routes/hr)
  > In this following schema has 3 tables called `users`, `department` and `designation`.
  > Under each table has these folders, for example in [users](./src/routes/hr/users):
  - Hono request handlers defined in [handlers.ts](./src/routes/hr/users/handlers.ts)
  - Router created in [index.ts](./src/routes/hr/users/index.ts)
  - Route definitions defined in [routes.ts](./src/routes/hr/users/routes.ts)
  - Zod validators defined in [utils.ts](./src/routes/hr/users/utils.ts)

All routes are merged in [index.route.ts](./src/routes/index.route.ts)<br>
All schema are merged in [index.schema.ts](./src/routes/index.schema.ts)<br>
All app routes are grouped together and exported into single type as `AppType` in [app.ts](./src/app.ts) for use in [RPC / hono/client](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc).

## Endpoints of `hr.users`

| GET       | /reference       | Scalar API Documentation |
| POST      | /hr/users        | Create a user            |
| PATCH     | /hr/users/{uuid} | Patch one user by uuid   |
